          <h2>@ Cox Automotive</h2>
          <p>
            I developed Kafka Streams applications for the collection and transformation of automotive website analytics data.
            This data was sent in real-time by thousands of dealership websites, as well as <a href="https://www.autotrader.com/">Autotrader</a>
            and <a href="https://www.kbb.com/">Kelley Blue Book</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I developed GraphQL APIs to expose datasets via an Apollo federated supergraph.
          </p>
          <p>
            I developed an API for url shortening, as well as an application to handle the
            lookup/redirect of the url, and to gather key consumer information.
            This API needed to handle peaks of 300,000 requests per minute and used AWS technologies such as
            Lambda, ECS, Fargate, API Gateway, Dynamo, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            I developed many serverless ETL pipelines to enhance and combine massive datasets,
            using AWS Glue, Lambda, ECS, SNS, SQS, S3, Dynamo, Aurora, and Step Functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the Technical Lead on my team, I worked with the Product Owner to groom features,
            as well as with Architects and Principals to bring new ideas and technologies into sight.
            I paired up often with other developers on the team to work through issues, and held 1-1s to check in on concerns.

          <h2>@ MicroStrain</h2>
          <h3>SensorConnect</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="http://www.microstrain.com/software/sensorconnect">SensorConnect</a> was the PC software for MicroStrain's wireless and wired sensors.
            It allowed customers to configure their hardware and visualize massive amounts of data in real-time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was the product owner, as well as a full-stack developer working with a team of developers.
            SensorConnect used the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef">Chromium Embedded Framework</a>,
            allowing for a modern UI using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, while maintaining a fast, efficient C++ backend.

          <h3>MSCL</h3>
          <p>
            I was the lead developer of <a href="http://www.microstrain.com/software/mscl">MSCL</a> (MicroStrain Communication Library).
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of MSCL was to have a library that was cross platform, multi-language, and enabled both internal developers and
            external customers writing their own software, to interact with all of MicroStrain's sensors.
            MSCL was made available in C++, C#, Python, MATLAB, and LabVIEW.
          </p>
          <p>
            I built MSCL from the ground up focusing on speed and usability.
            It was fully documented, unit tested, and included example code and quick start guides.
            I also worked directly with customers helping them debug any issues they had developing their own software using MSCL.

          <h3>SensorCloud.com</h3>
          <p>
            SensorCloud was MicroStrain's cloud platform for storing, visualizing, and analyzing data.
          </p>
          <p>
            I designed and developed the <a href="https://sensorcloud.com/">sensorcloud.com</a> website.
            This included designing the look and feel, generating all the content, and implementing every page
            with the goal of helping customers better understand our product, and ultimately driving more sales.
